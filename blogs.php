          <p style="font-size:12px;">You have to keep in mind the pandemic is still on and the Char Dham Yatra has been
            put on hold.<br></p>
          <p style="font-size:15px;"><b>While this is great news, you need to keep a few things in mind.</b><br>
            <b>1.</b> Everyone is scrambling to get things in order at the last moment: Hotels, our team, the forest
            department, the entire infrastructure on the trail. While everyone’s doing their best, there could be things
            that may not be in perfect order. Do take them in your stride.<br><br>

            <strong>2.</strong> Your designated hotels may not reopen by the time you reach there. While we are making alternate
            arrangements, do understand that things may not be as “tip-top” as our designated hotels.

              great photos and stories from the trek.</b><br>

            Sneha Yadav, our Social Media Manager reports, “We got brilliant weather during the trek. There were just
            light showers at Jwara after we reached the campsite. But the weather at Balu ka Ghara, Shea Goru, and even
            during the pass crossing was clear. We got to see brilliant mountain views.”<br>

            If you wish to explore this trek, now is the time to plan. Happy trekking!.<br><br>
